# RocketLCD
This code is running on a raspberry pi sitting on my desk.<br>
It has two HD44780 displays connected to it which display differen information.

The upper display shows the current time, date, temperature and humidity (data comes from a DHT22 sensor)<br>
and shows the current bitcoin price once a minute (data from the bitfinex api).

The lower display shows when the next rocket will launch into space (data from the launch library api)
